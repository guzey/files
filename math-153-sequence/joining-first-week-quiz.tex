\section{Bureaucracy}

Below are some hypotheticals.

\begin{enumerate}
\item You plan to fly for vacation to the Seychelles, and hence will
  be unable to take the course final exam. Which of the following
  options is {\em not} available?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Not taking the final exam and getting a $0$ subscore on the final
  \item Taking a W (withdraw) for the course
  \item Taking an I (incomplete) for the course and taking the final
    later when you return from the Seychelles
  \item Getting me to administer the final to you in tenth week
  \end{enumerate}

  \vspace{0.1in}

  \vspace{0.1in}

\item You want to switch sections. Till when can you do so?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Friday 5 PM of first week.
  \item Friday 5 PM of third week.
  \item Friday 5 PM of fifth week.
  \item Friday 5 PM of eight week.
  \item Any time until you see the final examination.
  \end{enumerate}

  \vspace{0.1in}

\item You want to switch to another section but it is full right now
  (you can see enrollment levels at the Time Schedules website). What do
  you do?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Get the instructor to sign a pink slip
  \item Get your adviser to register you
  \item Post to the UChicago Class of 2015 Facebook group asking for
    advice
  \item Tough luck. Unless {\em all} sections are full (in which case
    enrollment limits for sections will be increased), you will not be
    allowed to enroll in a section that is already full.

\section{Future courses}

\begin{enumerate}
  
\item If you plan to major in Economics proper (rather than a
  Math-with-Econ concentration) which of these classes do you need to
  take after Math 153?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Math 195 and Math 196
  \item Math 199-203-204
  \item Math 200 and Math 201
  \item Math 220
  \end{enumerate}

  \vspace{0.1in}
  Your answer: $\underline{\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad}$
  \vspace{0.1in}

\item If you plan to major in Math with Econ concentration
  (recommended for people planning for graduate school in economics),
  which of these classes do you need to take after Math 153?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Math 195 and Math 196
  \item Math 199-203-204
  \item Math 200 and Math 201
  \item Math 220
  \end{enumerate}

\item If you plan to major in Biochemistry or Chemistry, what classes
  are you expected to take after math 153?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Math 195 and Math 196
  \item Math 199-203-204
  \item Math 200 and Math 201
  \item Math 220

\item For those of you who plan to major in Biology, what is the
  relationship between the biocalculus course offered in the spring
  and your calculus classes.

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Biocalculus requires Math 153 as a prerequisite and builds on
    ideas that are covered in Math 153.
  \item Biocalculus requires that the person be taking Math 153
    concurrently or have done it in the past.
  \item Biocalculus can be taken by anybody doing Math 150s or Math
    130s and the mathematical prerequisites for understanding the
    material fall far short of what's covered in Math 153.
