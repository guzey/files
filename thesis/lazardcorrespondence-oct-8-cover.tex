Some changes I made to the rest of the document:

\begin{itemize}
\item Fixed some typographical errors.
\item Updated notation as follows. Now, for a central extension $E$ of
  $G$, I distinguish between the commutator-induced map $\omega_E:
  E/Z(E) \times E/Z(E) \to [E,E]$ and the map $\omega_{E,G}: G \times
  G \to [E,E]$. The map $\omega_{E,G}$ factors through
  $\omega_E$. Similarly, I use $\Omega_E$ to denote the map $E/Z(E)
  \wedge E/Z(E) \to [E,E]$ and $\Omega_{E,G}$ to denote the map $G
  \wedge G \to [E,E]$.

  In an earlier version of the document, I had used $\Omega_E$ for
  what I now call $\Omega_{E,G}$. I changed the notation because the
  old notation becomes very confusing when applied to the last few
  sections.
\item Made a similar update to the notation for Lie ring extensions.
\end{itemize}

The proofs with maximum chances of inadequately explained material are:

\begin{itemize}
\item The proofs in Section 33.4, particularly Theorem 33.5.
\item The proof of Theorem 37.4.
\end{itemize}

Some other potential issues:

\begin{itemize}
\item There is more new notation in Section 36 than I would like. That
  means there is a higher chance of some of the notation being wrong
  or misguided.
\end{itemize}

\end{document}
