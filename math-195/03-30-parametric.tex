A (*) in front of a question indicates that there exist one or more
strong distractors in the answer choices, so you need to be more careful.
\begin{enumerate}

\item Suppose $f$ and $g$ are both twice differentiable functions
  everywhere on $\R$. Which of the following is the correct formula
  for $(f \circ g)''$?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]

  \item $(f'' \circ g) \cdot g''$
  \item $(f'' \circ g) \cdot (f' \circ g') \cdot g''$
  \item $(f'' \circ g) \cdot (f' \circ g') \cdot (f \circ g'')$
  \item $(f'' \circ g) \cdot (g')^2 + (f' \circ g) \cdot g''$
  \item $(f' \circ g') \cdot (f \circ g) + (f'' \circ g'')$

\item Suppose $x = f(t)$ and $y = g(t)$ where $f$ and $g$ are both
  twice differentiable functions. What is $d^2y/dx^2$ in terms of $f$
  and $g$ and their derivatives evaluated at $t$?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item $(f'(t)g''(t) - g'(t)f''(t))/(f'(t))^3$
  \item $(f'(t)g''(t) - g'(t)f''(t))/(g'(t))^3$
  \item $(g'(t)f''(t) - f'(t)g''(t))/(f'(t))^3$
  \item $(g'(t)f''(t) - f'(t)g''(t))/(g'(t))^3$
  \item None of the above

\item Which of the following pair of bounds works for the arc length
  for the portion of the graph of the sine function between $(a,\sin
  a)$ and $(b, \sin b)$ where $a < b$?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Between $(b - a)/\sqrt{3}$ and $(b - a)/\sqrt{2}$
  \item Between $(b - a)/\sqrt{2}$ and $b - a$
  \item Between $(b - a)$ and $\sqrt{2}(b - a)$
  \item Between $\sqrt{2}(b - a)$ and $\sqrt{3}(b - a)$

\item (*) Consider the parametric curve $x = e^t$, $y = e^{t^2}$. How does
  $y$ grow in terms of $x$ as $x \to \infty$?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item $y$ grows like a polynomial in $x$.
  \item $y$ grows faster than any polynomial in $x$ but slower than an
    exponential function of $x$.
  \item $y$ grows exponentially in $x$.
  \item $y$ grows super-exponentially in $x$ but slower than a double
    exponential in $x$.
  \item $y$ grows like a double exponential in $x$.
  \end{enumerate}

\item (*) We say that a curve is {\em algebraic} if it admits a
  parameterization of the form $x = f(t)$, $y = g(t)$, where $f$ and
  $g$ are rational functions and $t$ varies over some subset of the real
  numbers. Which of the following curves is {\em not} algebraic?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item $x = \cos t$, $y = \sin t$, $t \in \R$
  \item $x = \cos t$, $y = \cos(3t)$, $t \in \R$
  \item $x = \cos t$, $y = \cos^2t$, $t \in \R$
  \item $x = \cos t$, $y = \cos(t^2)$, $t \in \R$
  \item None of the above, i.e., they are all algebraic
  \end{enumerate}

\item Suppose $x = f(t)$, $y = g(t)$, $t \in \R$ is a parametric
  description of a curve $\Gamma$ and both $f$ and $g$ are continuous
  on all of $\R$. If both $f$ and $g$ are even, what can we conclude
  about $\Gamma$ and its parameterization?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item $\Gamma$ is symmetric about the $y$-axis
  \item $\Gamma$ is symmetric about the $x$-axis
  \item $\Gamma$ is symmetric about the line $y = x$
  \item $\Gamma$ has half turn symmetry about the origin
  \item The parameterizations of $\Gamma$ for $t \le 0$ and for $t \ge
    0$ both cover all of $\Gamma$, and in directions mutually reverse
    to each other.
  \end{enumerate}
