{\bf PLEASE DISCUSS {\em ONLY} THE STARRED OR DOUBLE-STARRED QUESTIONS.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Suppose $f$ is a function of two variables, defined on all of
  $\R^2$, with the property that $f(x,y) = f(y,x)$ for all real
  numbers $x$ and $y$. What does this say about the symmetry of the
  graph $z = f(x,y)$ of $f$? {\em Last time: $16/21$ correct} -- DO
  NOT DISCUSS.

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item It has mirror symmetry about the plane $z = x + y$.
  \item It has mirror symmetry about the plane $x = y$.
  \item It has mirror symmetry about the plane $z = x - y$.
  \item It has half turn symmetry about the line $x = y = z$.
  \item It has half turn symmetry about the origin.
  \end{enumerate}

\item (**) Consider the function $f(x,y) := ax + by$ where $a$ and $b$ are
  fixed nonzero reals. The level curves for this function are a bunch
  of parallel lines. What vector are they all parallel to? {\em Last
  time: $5/21$ correct}

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item $\langle a,b \rangle$
  \item $\langle a,-b \rangle$.
  \item $\langle b,a \rangle$
  \item $\langle b,-a \rangle$
  \item $\langle a - b, a + b \rangle$

\item (**) Suppose $f$ is a function of one variable and $g$ is a function
  of two variables. What is the relationship between the level curves
  of $f \circ g$ and the level curves of $g$? {\em Last time: $7/21$ correct}

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Each level curve of $f \circ g$ is a union of level curves of
    $g$ corresponding to the pre-images of the point under $f$.
  \item Each level curve of $f \circ g$ is an intersection of level
    curves of $g$ corresponding to the pre-images of the point under $f$.
  \item The level curves of $f \circ g$ are precisely the same as the
    level curves of $g$.
  \item Each level curve of $g$ is a union of level curves of $f \circ g$.
  \item Each level curve of $g$ is an intersection of level curves of $f \circ g$.

\item Consider the following function $f$ from $\R^2$ to $\R^2$: the
  function that sends $\langle x,y \rangle$ to $\langle \frac{x +
  y}{2}, \frac{x - y}{2} \rangle$. What is the image of $\langle x,y
  \rangle$ under $f \circ f$? {\em Last time: $12/21$ correct} -- DO
  NOT DISCUSS.

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item $\langle x,y \rangle$
  \item $\langle 2x,2y \rangle$
  \item $\langle x/2,y/2 \rangle$
  \item $\langle x + (y/2), y + (x/2) \rangle$
  \item $\langle 2x + y, 2x - y \rangle$

\item (**) Consider the following functions defined on the subset $x >
  0$ of the $xy$-plane: $f(x,y) = x^y$. Consider the surface $z =
  f(x,y)$. What do the intersections of this surface with planes
  parallel to the $xz$-plane and $yz$-plane look like (ignore the
  following two special intersections: intersection with the plane $x
  = 1$ and intersection with the plane $y = 0$, also ignore
  intersections that turn out to be empty). {\em Last time: $5/21$
  correct}

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Intersections with any plane parallel to the $xz$ or $yz$
    plane look like graphs of exponential functions.
  \item Intersections with any plane parallel to the $xz$ or $yz$
    plane look like graphs of power functions (only positive inputs allowed).
  \item Intersections with any plane parallel to the $xz$-plane look
    like graphs of exponential functions, and intersections with any
    plane parallel to the $yz$-plane look like graphs of power
    functions (only positive inputs allowed).
  \item Intersections with any plane parallel to the $yz$-plane look
    like graphs of exponential functions, and intersections with any
    plane parallel to the $xz$-plane look like graphs of power
    functions (only positive inputs allowed).
  \item All the intersections are straight lines.
