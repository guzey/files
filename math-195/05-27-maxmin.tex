\begin{enumerate}
\item Suppose $F(x,y) := f(x) + g(y)$, i.e., $F$ is additively
  separable. Suppose $f$ and $g$ are continuous functions of one
  variable, defined for all real numbers. Which of the following
  statements about local extrema of $F$ is {\bf false}?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item If $f$ has a local minimum at $x_0$ and $g$ has a local
    minimum at $y_0$, then $F$ has a local minimum at $(x_0,y_0)$.
  \item If $f$ has a local minimum at $x_0$ and $g$ has a local
    maximum at $y_0$, then $F$ has a saddle point at $(x_0,y_0)$.
  \item If $f$ has a local maximum at $x_0$ and $g$ has a local
    minimum at $y_0$, then $F$ has a saddle point at $(x_0,y_0)$.
  \item If $f$ has a local maximum at $x_0$ and $g$ has a local
    maximum at $y_0$, then $F$ has a local maximum at $(x_0,y_0)$.
  \item None of the above, i.e., they are all true.

\item Suppose $F(x,y) := f(x)g(y)$ is a multiplicatively separable
  function. Suppose $f$ and $g$ are both continuous functions of
  one variable defined for all real inputs. Consider a point
  $(x_0,y_0)$ in the domain of $F$, which is $\R^2$. Which of the
  following statements about local extrema is {\bf true}?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item If $f$ has a local minimum at $x_0$ and $g$ has a local
    minimum at $y_0$, then $F$ has a local minimum at $(x_0,y_0)$.
  \item If $f$ has a local minimum at $x_0$ and $g$ has a local
    maximum at $y_0$, then $F$ has a saddle point at $(x_0,y_0)$.
  \item If $f$ has a local maximum at $x_0$ and $g$ has a local
    minimum at $y_0$, then $F$ has a saddle point at $(x_0,y_0)$.
  \item If $f$ has a local maximum at $x_0$ and $g$ has a local
    maximum at $y_0$, then $F$ has a local maximum at $(x_0,y_0)$.
  \item None of the above, i.e., they are all false.
