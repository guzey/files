Suppose $F$ is a function of two real variables, say $x$
and $t$, so $F(x,t)$ is a real number for $x$ and $t$ restricted to
suitable open intervals in the real number. Suppose, further, that $F$
is jointly continuous (whatever that means) in $x$ and $t$.

Define $f(t) := \int_0^\infty F(x,t) \, dx$. Here, while doing the
integration, $t$ is treated as a constant. $x$, the variable of
integration, is being integrated on $[0,\infty)$.
  
Suppose further that $f$ is defined and continuous for $t$ in
$(0,\infty)$.

In the next few questions, you are asked to compute the function $f$
explicitly given the function $F$, for $t \in (0,\infty)$.

\begin{enumerate}

\item $F(x,t) := e^{-tx}$. Find $f$.

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item $f(t) = e^{-t}/t$
  \item $f(t) = e^t/t$
  \item $f(t) = 1/t$
  \item $f(t) = -1/t$
  \item $f(t) = -t$
  \end{enumerate}

  {\em Answer}: Option (C)

  {\em Explanation}: The integral becomes
  $[-e^{-tx}/t]_0^\infty$. Plugging in at $\infty$ gives $0$ and
  plugging in at $0$ gives $-1/t$. Since the value at $0$ is being
  subtracted, we eventually get $1/t$.

  Note that the answer must be positive for the simple reason that we
  are integrating a positive function from left to right across an
  interval.

  {\em Historical note}: This question appeared in a 153 quiz. At the
  time, $17$ out of $25$ people got this correct. $4$ chose (A), $3$
  chose (D), and $1$ chose (E).

\item $F(x,t) := 1/(t^2 + x^2)$. Find $f$.

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item $f(t) = \pi/(2t)$
  \item $f(t) = \pi/t$
  \item $f(t) = 2\pi/t$
  \item $f(t) = \pi t$
  \item $f(t) = 2\pi t$
  \end{enumerate}

  {\em Answer}: Option (A)

  {\em Explanation}: We get $[(1/t)\arctan(x/t)]_0^\infty$. The
  evaluation at $\infty$ gives $\pi/(2t)$ and the evaluation at $0$
  gives $0$. Subtracting, we get $\pi/(2t)$.

  {\em Historical note}: This question appeared in a 153 quiz. At the
  time, $17$ out of $25$ got this correct. $5$ chose (B), $2$ chose
  (D), $1$ chose (C).

\item $F(x,t) := 1/(t^2 + x^2)^2$. Find $f$.

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item $f(t) = \pi/t^3$
  \item $f(t) = \pi/(2t^3)$
  \item $f(t) = \pi/(4t^3)$
  \item $f(t) = \pi/(8t^3)$
  \item $f(t) = 3\pi/(8t^3)$
  \end{enumerate}

  {\em Answer}: Option (C)

  {\em Explanation}: Put in $\theta = \arctan(x/t)$. Substitute, and
  we get $(1/t^3) \int_0^{\pi/2} \cos^2\theta \,
  d\theta$. Integrating, we get $[\theta/2t^3 +
  \sin(2\theta)/4t^3]_0^{\pi/2}$. The trigonometric part vanishes
  between limits, and we are left with $\pi/(4t^3)$

  {\em Historical note}: This question appeared in a 153 quiz. At the
  time, $15$ out of $25$ people got this correct. $5$ chose (B), $2$
  chose (A), $1$ each chose (D) and (E), $1$ left the question blank.

\item $F(x,t) = \exp(-(tx)^2)$. Use that $\int_0^\infty \exp(-x^2) \, dx=
  \sqrt{\pi}/2$. Find $f$.

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item $f(t) = t^2\sqrt{\pi}/2$
  \item $f(t) = t\sqrt{\pi}/2$
  \item $f(t) = \sqrt{\pi}/2$
  \item $f(t) = \sqrt{\pi}/(2t)$
  \item $f(t) = \sqrt{\pi}/(2t^2)$
  \end{enumerate}

  {\em Answer}: Option (D)

  {\em Explanation}: Put $u = tx$, get a $1/t$ on the outside, giving
  $(1/t) \int_0^\infty \exp(-u^2) \, du$.

  {\em Historical note}: This question appeared in a 153 quiz. At the
  time, $12$ out of $25$ people got the question correct. $6$ chose
  (E), $3$ chose (C), $2$ each chose (A) and (B).

\item In the same general setup as above (but with none of these
  specific $F$s), which of the following is a {\em sufficient}
  condition for $f$ to be an increasing function of $t$?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item $t \mapsto F(x_0,t)$ is an increasing function of $t$ for
    every choice of $x_0 \ge 0$.
  \item $x \mapsto F(x,t_0)$ is an increasing function of $x$ for
    every choice of $t_0 \in (0,\infty)$.
  \item $t \mapsto F(x_0,t)$ is a decreasing function of $t$ for
    every choice of $x_0 \ge 0$.
  \item $x \mapsto F(x,t_0)$ is a decreasing function of $x$ for
  every choice of $t_0 \in (0,\infty)$.
  \item None of the above.
  \end{enumerate}

  {\em Answer}: Option (A)

  {\em Explanation}: If $F$ is increasing in $t$ for every value of
  $x_0$, then that means that as $t$ gets bigger, the function $F$
  being integrated gets bigger everywhere in $x$, i.e., if $t_1 <
  t_2$, then $F(t_1,x_0) < F(t_2,x_0)$ for every $x_0 \ge 0$. The
  integral for the larger value $t_2$ must therefore also be
  bigger. (We looked at this stuff in Section 5.8 of the book).

  {\em Historical note}: This question appeared in a 153 quiz. At the
  time, $4$ out of $25$ got the question correct. $10$ chose (B), $5$
  chose (E), $3$ chose (C), $2$ chose (D), and $1$ left the question
  blank.

  (A) was the ``obvious'' choice -- people may have tried to seek more
  subtletly in the question than it had.

  (end of the above setup)

\item Suppose $f$ is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $d >
  0$. Define $g$ as the following function on positive reals: $g(a)$
  is the double integral of $f$ on the square $[0,a] \times
  [0,a]$. Assuming that $g(a)$ is not identically the zero function,
  which of these best describes the nature of $g(a)$?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item A constant times $a^d$
  \item A constant times $a^{d + 1}$
  \item A constant times $a^{d + 2}$
  \item A constant times $a^{2d + 1}$
  \item A constant times $a^{2d + 2}$
  \end{enumerate}

  {\em Answer}: Option (C)

  {\em Explanation}: Each monomial is of the form a constant times
  $x^py^q$ where $p + q = d$. Integrating this as a multiplicatively
  separable function gives $x^{p+1}y^{q+1}$ times a
  constant. Evaluating between limits gives $a^{d + 2}$ times a
  constant. This is the form of the double integral of each monomial,
  and hence the double integral of the sum is also of the same form.

\item Suppose $g(x,y)$ and $G(x,y)$ are continuous functions of two
  variables and $G_{xy} = g$. How can the double integral $\int_s^t
  \int_u^v g(x,y) \, dy \, dx$ be described in terms of the values of
  $G$?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item $G(v,t) + G(u,s) - G(u,t) - G(v,s)$
  \item $G(v,t) - G(v,s) + G(u,t) - G(u,s)$
  \item $G(t,v) + G(s,u) - G(t,u) - G(s,v)$
  \item $G(t,v) - G(s,v) + G(t,u) - G(s,u)$
  \item $G(t,v) + G(v,t) - G(s,u) - G(u,s)$
  \end{enumerate}

  {\em Answer}: Option (C)

  {\em Explanation}: Note that the integration is over $[s,t] \times
  [u,v]$, i.e., the rectangular region with corner points $(s,u)$,
  $(s,v)$, $(t,u)$, and $(t,v)$. Recall that for the double integral,
  we put positive signs on the two extreme points (top right and
  bottom left) and negative signs on the other two points (top left
  and bottom right). See more in the lecture notes.

\item Suppose $f$ is an elementarily integrable function, but $f(x^k)$
  is not elementarily integrable for any integer $k > 1$ (examples are
  $\sin$, $\exp$, $\cos$). For which of the following types of regions
  $D$ are we {\em guaranteed to be able} to compute, in elementary
  function terms, the double integral $\int \int_D f(x^2) \, dA$ over
  the region (note that $f$ is just a function of $x$, but we treat it
  as a function of two variables)?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item A rectangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(0,b)$, $(a,0)$, and
    $(a,b)$, with $a,b > 0$.
  \item A triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(0,b)$, $(a,0)$, with $a, b
    > 0$.
  \item A triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(0,b)$, $(a,b)$, with $a, b
    > 0$.
  \item A triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(a,0)$, $(a,b)$, with $a, b
    > 0$.
  \item All of the above
  \end{enumerate}

  {\em Answer}: Option (D)

  {\em Explanation}: For such a triangle, we integrate on $y$ inner
  and $x$ outer. For a fixed value of $x$, the $y$-value ranges from
  $0$ to $bx/a$, so the integral becomes:

  $$\int_0^a \int_0^(bx/a} f(x^2) \, dy \, dx$$

  $\sin(x^2)$ pulls out of the inner integral and the inner integral
  just gives $(bx/a)$, so we get:

  $$\int_0^a \frac{b}{a} xf(x^2) \, dx$$

  This can be done by the substitution $u = x^2$ and the knowledge
  that $f$ is elementarily integrable.

  All the other integrations stumble because they require knowledge of
  an antiderivative of $f(x^2)$.
