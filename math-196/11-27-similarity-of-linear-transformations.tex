{\bf PLEASE FEEL FREE TO DISCUSS {\em ALL} QUESTIONS.}

This quiz corresponds to material discussed in the lecture notes
titled {\tt Coordinates}. It also corresponds to Section 3.4 of the
text.

Recall that $n \times n$ matrices $A$ and $B$ are termed {\em similar}
if there exists an invertible $n \times n$ matrix $S$ such that $A =
SBS^{-1}$. The relation of matrices being similar is an {\em
  equivalence relation} (please refer to the notes for an explanation
of the terminology).

For these questions, assume $n > 1$, because a lot of phenomena are
much simpler in the case $n = 1$ and you may be misled if you look
only at that case. In other words, just because an equality is true
for $1 \times 1$ matrices, do not assume it is always true. On the
other hand, if you can find {\em counterexamples} to a statement for
$1 \times 1$ matrices, you can probably use that to construct
counterexamples for all sizes of matrices by using scalar matrices.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Which of the following can we say about two (possibly equal,
  possibly distinct) similar $n \times n$ matrices $A$ and $B$? Please
  see Options (D) and (E) before answering.

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item $A$ is invertible if and only if $B$ is invertible.
  \item $A$ is nilpotent if and only if $B$ is nilpotent.
  \item $A$ is idempotent if and only if $B$ is idempotent.
  \item All of the above.
  \item None of the above.
  \end{enumerate}

  \item $A$ is similar to $B$ if and only if $A^2$ is similar to $B^2$.

    $B$. However, $A$ being similar to $B$ does not imply that $A^2$
    is similar to $B^2$.

\item Suppose $A$ and $B$ are $n \times n$ matrices (but they are not
  given to be similar and they are not given to be invertible). We say
  that $A$ and $B$ are {\em quasi-similar} (not a standard term!) if
  there exist $n \times n$ matrices $C$ and $D$ such that $A = CD$ and
  $B = DC$. What can we say is the relation between being similar and
  being quasi-similar?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item $A$ and $B$ are similar if and only if they are quasi-similar.
  \item If $A$ and $B$ are similar, they are quasi-similar. However,
    the converse is not necessarily true: $A$ and $B$ may be
    quasi-similar but not similar.
  \item If $A$ and $B$ are quasi-similar, they are similar. However,
    the converse is not necessarily true: $A$ and $B$ may be similar
    but not quasi-similar.
  \item Neither implies the other. $A$ and $B$ may be similar but not
    quasi-similar. Also, $A$ and $B$ may be quasi-similar but not
    similar.

\item With the notion of quasi-similar as defined in the preceding
  question, what can we say about the relation between being similar
  and being quasi-similar for $n \times n$ matrices $A$ and $B$ that
  are both given to be {\em invertible}?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item $A$ and $B$ are similar if and only if they are quasi-similar.
  \item If $A$ and $B$ are similar, they are quasi-similar. However,
    the converse is not necessarily true: $A$ and $B$ may be
    quasi-similar but not similar.
  \item If $A$ and $B$ are quasi-similar, they are similar. However,
    the converse is not necessarily true: $A$ and $B$ may be similar
    but not quasi-similar.
  \item Neither implies the other. $A$ and $B$ may be similar but not
    quasi-similar. Also, $A$ and $B$ may be quasi-similar but not
    similar.

\item Suppose $A$ and $B$ are two $n \times n$ matrices. Which of the
  following best describes the relation between similarity and having
  the same rank?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item $A$ and $B$ are similar if and only if they have the same rank.
  \item If $A$ and $B$ are similar, then they have the same
    rank. However, it is possible for $A$ and $B$ to have the same
    rank but not be similar.
  \item If $A$ and $B$ have the same rank, then they are
    similar. However, it is possible for $A$ and $B$ to be similar but
    not have the same rank.
  \item $A$ and $B$ may be similar but have different ranks. Also, $A$
    and $B$ may have the same rank but not be similar.
