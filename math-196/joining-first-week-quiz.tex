Below are some hypotheticals.

\section{Course structure}

\begin{enumerate}

\item If you do not intend to take Math 199 or higher level
  mathematics courses, what courses do you need to take, beyond Math
  133/153, to complete your course requirements if you intend to major
  in economics?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Math 195 {\em or} Math 196
  \item Math 195 {\em and} Math 196
  \item Math 195 only
  \item Math 196 only
  \end{enumerate}

  \vspace{0.1in}
  Your answer: $\underline{\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad}$
  \vspace{0.1in}

\item What is the relationship between Math 195 and Math 196?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Math 195 is a formal prerequisite for Math 196.
  \item Math 196 is a formal prerequisite for Math 195.
  \item Neither course is a prerequisite for the other, but it is generally preferred that students do Math 195 before Math 196.
  \item Neither course is a prerequisite for the other, but it is
    generally preferred that students do Math 196 before Math 195.
  \end{enumerate}

  \vspace{0.1in}
  Your answer: $\underline{\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad}$
  \vspace{0.1in}

\item What courses do you need to take if you intend to major in
  economics but want to avoid taking Math 195 and/or Math 196?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Math 199 only
  \item Math 199 and Math 203 only
  \item Math 199, 203, and 204 only
  \item Math 199, 203, 204, and 205 only
  \item Math 199, 203, 204, 205, 254, 255, and 256
  \end{enumerate}

  Your answer: $\underline{\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad}$
  \vspace{0.1in}

  {\em For budding economists}: There is another alternative available
  to you: Math with Econ specialization. This requires you to take
  more math classes than the ones listed above, but if you are
  considering it, it's better to start on the above, then decide
  whether you want to stop at the point necessary for Econ or go
  further and do Math with Econ.

\item What mathematics class for a physical sciences major (such as
  chemistry or biochemistry) can be substituted for by the combination
  of Math 195 and Math 196?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Math 198
  \item Math 199
  \item Math 200
  \item Math 201
  \item Math 202
  \end{enumerate}

  \vspace{0.1in}
  Your answer: $\underline{\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad}$
  \vspace{0.1in}

  There may be other majors that don't strictly require you to take
  Math 196, but where this class will count towards your list of
  approved non-major courses. I'm not including specific questions
  dealing with these other majors in the quiz here.
