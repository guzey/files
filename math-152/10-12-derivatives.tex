Your name (print clearly in capital letters): $\underline{\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad}$

Write your answer in the space provided. In the space below, you can
explain your work if you want (this will not affect scoring). I may or
may not get time to look at the work you have done, but it may help
you recall how you arrived at a particular answer.

You are expected to take about one minute per question.

\begin{enumerate}

\item (**) Suppose $f$ is a differentiable function on $\R$. Which of the
  following implications is {\bf false}? {\em Last year: $0/14$
  correct}

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item If $f$ is even, then $f'$ is odd.
  \item If $f$ is odd, then $f'$ is even.
  \item If $f'$ is even, then $f$ is odd.
  \item If $f'$ is odd, then $f$ is even.
  \item None of the above, i.e., they are all true.
  \end{enumerate}

\item (*) A function $f$ on $\R$ is said to satisfy the {\em intermediate
  value property} if, for any $a < b \in \R$, and any $d$ between
  $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, there exists $c \in [a,b]$ such that $f(c) =
  d$. Which (one or more) of the following functions satisfies the
  intermediate value property? {\em Last year: $7/14$ correct}

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]

  \item $f(x) := \lbrace\begin{array}{rl} \sin(1/x), & x \ne 0\\ 0, & x = 0 \\\end{array}$
  \item $f(x) := \lbrace\begin{array}{rl} 1, & x \text{ rational} \\0, & x \text{ irrational}\\\end{array}$
  \item $f(x) := \lbrace\begin{array}{rl} x, & x \text{ rational} \\0, & x \text{ irrational}\\\end{array}$
  \item All of the above
  \item None of the above
  \end{enumerate}

  {\bf PLEASE TURN OVER FOR THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUESTION.}

\newpage

\item Which (one or more) of the following functions have a period of
  $\pi$? {\em Last year: $12/14$ correct}

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item $x \mapsto \sin^2 x$
  \item $x \mapsto |\sin x|$
  \item $x \mapsto \cos^2 x$
  \item $x \mapsto |\cos x|$
  \item All of the above
  \end{enumerate}

\item Suppose $f$ is a function defined on all of $\R$ such that $f'$
  is a periodic function defined on all of $\R$. What can we conclude
  is {\bf definitely true} about $f$? {\em Last year: $8/14$ correct}

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]

  \item $f$ must be a linear function.
  \item $f$ must be a periodic function.
  \item $f$ can be expressed as the sum of a linear and a periodic
    function, but $f$ need not be either linear or periodic.
  \item $f$ can be expressed as the product of a linear and periodic
    function, but $f$ need not be either linear or periodic.
  \item $f$ can be expressed as a composite of a linear and a periodic
    function, but $f$ need not be either linear or periodic.
