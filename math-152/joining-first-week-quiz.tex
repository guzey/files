\section{Bureaucracy}

Below are some hypotheticals.

\begin{enumerate}
\item You plan to fly for vacation to the Seychelles on Monday,
  December 5, 2011, and hence will be unable to take the course final
  scheduled for Tuesday December 6, 2011, 4-6 PM. Which of the
  following options is {\em not} available?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Not taking the final exam and getting a $0$ subscore on the final
  \item Taking a W (withdraw) for the course
  \item Taking an I (incomplete) for the course and taking the final
    later when you return from the Seychelles
  \item Getting me to administer the final to you in tenth week
  \end{enumerate}

  \vspace{0.1in}
  Your answer: $\underline{\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad}$
  \vspace{0.1in}

\item You want to switch sections. Till when can you do so?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Friday 5 PM of first week.
  \item Friday 5 PM of third week.
  \item Friday 5 PM of fifth week.
  \item Friday 5 PM of eight week.
  \item Any time until you see the final examination.
  \end{enumerate}

  \vspace{0.1in}
  Your answer: $\underline{\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad}$
  \vspace{0.1in}

\item You want to switch to another section but it is full right now
  (you can see enrollment levels at the Time Schedules website). What do
  you do?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Get the instructor to sign a pink slip
  \item Get your adviser to register you
  \item Post to the UChicago Class of 2015 Facebook group asking for
    advice
  \item Tough luck. Unless {\em all} sections are full (in which case
    enrollment limits for sections will be increased), you will not be
    allowed to enroll in a section that is already full.
  \end{enumerate}

\item You want to switch to a lower level course (such as 151 or
  131). Till when can you do so?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Friday 5 PM of first week.
  \item Friday 5 PM of third week.
  \item Friday 5 PM of fifth week.
  \item Friday 5 PM of eight week.
  \item Any time until you see the final examination.

\item You want to try a higher level course than you were placed
  into. What is the right approach to doing so?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item Ask your friends on Facebook what to do
  \item Convince the instructor in the course you are switching out from
  \item Convince the instructor in the course you are switching up to
  \item Talk to Diane Herrmann in Eckhart 212 and convince her to make
    a deal with you
  \item Get your adviser to register you in the higher level course

\item What is the key difference between Calculus 150s and Calculus 160s?

  \begin{enumerate}[(A)]
  \item 150s is more computationally focused, 160s is more proof-based
    and better as a stepping down for math and physics majors
  \item 150s is single variable calculus, 160s is multivariable calculus
  \item 150s involves very simple computations, 160s involves more challenging computations
  \end{enumerate}

  \item 130s is precalculus, 150s is calculus
  \item 130s has no proofs, 150s has some proofs
  \item 130s and 150s are both calculus but 130s also includes some
    precalculus review as students taking it generally are not that
