A $n$-dimensional pseudomanifold is a simplicial complex with the
following properties:

\begin{enumerate}
  
\item Every simplex in it is a subsimplex of some $n$-simplex

\item Every $n-1$-simplex lies in at most two $n$-simplices
  
\item Given any two $n$-simplices we can find a sequence of
  $n$-simplices starting at the first and ending at the second, so
  that any two adjacent terms in the sequence intersect in a
  $n-1$-simplex.  That is, if $s$ and $s'$ are two $n$-simplices, we
  can find a sequence $s = s_0, s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_m = s'$ such that the
  intersection of $s_i$ and $s_{i-1}$ is a $n-1$-simplex.
\end{enumerate}

The {\em boundary} of a $n$-dimensional pseudomanifold is the union of
all the $n-1$-simplices which lie in {\em only} one $n$-simplex. The
boundary of $K$ is denoted by $\dot K$. A pseudomanifold {\em without
  boundary} is a pseudomanifold whose boundary is empty. Equivalently,
for pseudomanifolds, condition (2) is replaced by the statement:
``every $n-1$-simplex lies in {\em exactly} two $n$-simplices''.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[B1) ] Let $(X,A)$ be a pair and assume that two of the three
  graded groups $H(A),H(X),$ and $H(X,A)$ are finitely generated. Prove
  that the third is also finitely generated and that
  $\chi(X)=\chi(A)+\chi(X,A)$.
\item[B2) ] Let $\{X_1,X_2\}$ be an excisive couple of subsets of $X$
  such that $H(X_1)$ and $H(X_2)$ are finitely generated. Prove that
  $H(X_1\cup X_2)$ is finitely generated if and only if $H(X_1\cap
  X_2)$ is finitely generated, in which case
  \[
  \chi(X_1)+\chi(X_2)=\chi(X_1\cup X_2)+\chi(X_1\cap X_2).
  \]
\item[B4) ] If $X$ and $Y$ are finite CW complexes, prove that
  \[
  \chi(X\times Y)=\chi(X)\chi(Y).
  \]
\item[E1) ] Let $K$ be an $n$-dimensional pseudomanifold. Prove that
  it is possible to enumerate the $n$-simplexes of $K$ in a (finite or
  infinite) sequence $s_0,s_1,\ldots,s_q,\ldots$ and to find a
  sequence $s_1',s_2',\ldots,s_q',\ldots$ of $(n-1)$-simplexes of $K$
  such that for $q\ge1$, $s_q'$ is a face of $s_q$ and also a face of
  $s_i$ for some $i<q$.
\item[E2) ] If $K$ is a finite $n$-dimensional pseudomanifold and
  $\dot K$ is empty (viz, $K$ is a finite $n$-dimensional
  pseudomanifold  {\em without boundary}) prove that the $n^{th}$ homology is either infinite
  cyclic, or $0$.
